This project is an image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a responsive grid layout displaying categorized images.
Users can click on any image to view it in a modal window, where they can see a
larger version of the image along with its description. The modal also includes a download button for saving the image locally and a back button to return to the gallery view.
